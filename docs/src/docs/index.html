  <h2 id="h2-what-is-skate">What is Skate?</h2>
  <p>Skate provides an API to bind behaviours to DOM elements. It's based on the W3C specification for  <a href="http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/">Custom Elements</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="custom-elements-header">Custom Elements</h3>

  <p>Skate uses the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/">W3C Custom Element Spec</a> as the basis for defining its functionality and extends it to make it easier for you to build new custom elements as well as transition your legacy components to custom elements.</p>
  <p>Custom elements are just normal HTML elements that you give a custom name and functionality to:</p>

    <todo-list>
      <todo-item>Get milk</todo-item>
      <todo-item>Feed cats</todo-item>
    </todo-list>
  </noscript>

  <h3> Why should you use it?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Skate is small: 5kb minified and gzipped.</li>
    <li>Built and measured to perform under extreme circumstances, even in IE.</li>
    <li>Helps keep you focused and productive while making your code clear and expressive.</li>
    <li>Easily transition from selector-based behaviour binding to element binding.</li>
  </ul>
